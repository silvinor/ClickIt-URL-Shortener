c1k.it is an open source project - it's source is free (as in freedom) and
free (as in no-cost). Its source is hosted on GitHub.

Basically, that means that you can use its source for your own work, including
commercial uses. But...

[ ]  You must attribute (or openly mention) the original Author.
[ ]  You must "share alike" – meaning you'll need to make the parts that you
     use or modify also freely available.

The best way to do that is to have a link back to the source repository on
GitHub using one of the two ("c1k.it") logos (found in the includes folder).

But writing ones code from scratch is ludicrous, so we’ve used some other work
that needs attribution:
